# Machine Learning Workflow Functions

## Introduction
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of functions that cover various stages of the machine learning workflow. From exploratory data analysis to building regression models, evaluating their performance, and handling imbalanced datasets, this repository offers a versatile toolkit to support your machine learning projects. This repo will always be updated.


## Features

- `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Gain insights into your dataset using functions designed to summarize and visualize key statistics, identify missing values, handle outliers, and explore the relationships between variables.
- `Inference Statistics`: Perform statistical analysis on your data with functions that calculate descriptive statistics, conduct hypothesis tests, and generate confidence intervals to derive meaningful insights and validate assumptions.
- `Visualization`: Create impactful visualizations of your data using functions for plotting histograms, scatter plots, line charts, and more, helping you communicate patterns and trends effectively.
- `Splitting Data`: Split your dataset into training, validation, and testing sets using functions that provide various strategies like random sampling, stratified sampling, and time-based splitting.
- `Building Regression Models`: Develop regression models using functions that support various algorithms, allowing you to train and fine-tune your models based on the specific requirements of your problem.
- `Evaluation of Models`: Assess the performance of your regression models with functions that calculate common evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- `Weighting Sample for Imbalanced Dataset`: Address the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets by utilizing functions that apply appropriate sampling techniques to balance class distribution and improve model performance.
